COBE stands for Code of Business Ethics. Cobe is a database backed,
Python port of MegaHAL.

It has been inspired by the success of Hailo:

Our goals are similar: an on-disk data store for lower memory usage,
better support for Unicode, and general stability.

Dependencies:

* python-cmdparse:

  $ git clone git://github.com/pteichman/python-cmdparse.git
  $ easy_install python-cmdparse

Usage:

  $ cobe init
  $ cobe console
